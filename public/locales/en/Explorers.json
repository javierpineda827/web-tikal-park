He was fleeing Tayasal and trying to find a safe route to Merida, as he learned about a conspiracy against him led by the apparently friendly king, Canek of the Itza.  In his chronicles he describes passing through an impressive ancient city, full of buildings and vaulted houses whitewashed with plaster in the course of his escape.</p>",
